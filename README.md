# Iris-Dataset-Exploration-and-Analysis
Explore and analyze the Iris dataset using pandas and seaborn to visualize distributions, boxplots, pair plots, and correlations. Discover insights into sepal and petal measurements across Iris species.

Long Description:
The Iris Dataset Exploration and Analysis program utilizes pandas for data manipulation and seaborn for visualization to delve into the well-known Iris dataset. Initially, it loads the dataset and creates a DataFrame to examine its structure and compute statistical summaries such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation of numeric features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The program showcases histograms to visualize distributions of these features and boxplots to understand their spread across Iris species. It also generates a pair plot to explore relationships between variables and uses a heatmap to depict the correlation matrix, highlighting interdependencies among features.

Designed for both beginners and data enthusiasts, this tool provides a comprehensive exploration of botanical data, offering insights into how different Iris species vary in their morphological attributes. It serves as a foundational step in data analysis, demonstrating techniques for visualizing and interpreting multivariate datasets to uncover patterns and correlations in botanical research and beyond.
